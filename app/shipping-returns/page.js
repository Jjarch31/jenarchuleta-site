          <h2>Signed copies of the book</h2>
          <p>
            Each signed copy is personalized and signed by hand by Jen, one at a time. Please allow
            2&ndash;3 weeks for your order to ship. Orders currently ship within the United States only.
            Because each book is personalized to your order, we&rsquo;re unable to accept returns for a
            change of mind, but if your book arrives damaged or defective, contact us within 14 days at{' '}
            <a href={`mailto:${CONTACT_EMAIL}`}>{CONTACT_EMAIL}</a> with a photo, and we&rsquo;ll make it
            right with a replacement or refund.

          <h2>The Signature Velvet Bookmark</h2>
          <p>
            Each bookmark is handmade in small batches, and no two are exactly alike. Once a batch is
            available for purchase, the same damaged/defective policy above applies. Because these are
            handmade, one-of-a-kind pieces, all other sales are final.

          <h2>Velvet Circle Membership</h2>
          <p>
            The Velvet Circle Membership is a recurring monthly subscription billed at $9.99/month until
            you cancel. It includes the passcode to The Velvet Letter, and written answers to up to 3 questions a month. Live monthly Zooms begin
            once the Velvet Circle reaches 13 members. Until then, members can send me up to 3 questions
            each month, and I&rsquo;ll answer every one in writing. You can cancel anytime before your next billing date to avoid being charged for
            the following month; charges already processed for the current billing period are
            non-refundable. Your membership stays active through the end of the billing period
            you&rsquo;ve already paid for. We don&rsquo;t offer refunds for time already used, but
            you&rsquo;ll never be charged again after you cancel. You can manage or cancel your
            membership anytime through the link in your subscription receipt email
            {STRIPE_CUSTOMER_PORTAL_URL ? (
              <>
