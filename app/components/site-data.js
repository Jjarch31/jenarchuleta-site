// BOOKMARK — three states, checked in this order by app/shop/page.js:
//   1. `bookmark` has a buy.stripe.com URL  → live "Buy" button.
//      Only set this when a finished batch exists. Create the Payment Link in
//      Stripe (Products → Signature Velvet Bookmark → Payment Link, enable
//      "Collect shipping address" AND "Limit the number of payments" = the
//      batch size, so it can never oversell) and paste the URL here.
//   2. else `bookmarkWaitlist` has a Kit landing-page URL → "Join the
//      first-drop list" button. Create the landing page in Kit (Grow →
//      Landing Pages & Forms) with the tag "Bookmark Waitlist" and paste
//      its URL here.
//   3. else both empty → the card shows a quiet "Coming soon" state with no
//      dead links.
//
// Prices and the fulfillment promise live here too, so copy changes never
// require touching page code.
