## 0. Related context — read these too if the task touches brand, book, or commerce

This file covers the **site's code and infrastructure**. It does NOT duplicate the book/brand
canon or the live commerce state — those live in their own maintained sources, and duplicating
them here would just create a second copy that goes stale (it already has, once). Check these
when relevant:

- **Book & brand canon (voice, positioning, launch status):** Google Drive **"JEN ARCHULETA —
  BRAND HQ"** → `STUDIO_LOG.md` at the root is the canonical, continuously-updated log. Also
  `~/Documents/Jennifer/00_PROJECT_INDEX.md` (local working index, read first for anything
  book/content/launch-related).
- **Live commerce + legal + automation state (Stripe products, prices, Payment Links, the
  Make.com automation, Kit tags, Google Sheet tracker):** `~/Documents/Jennifer/07_Legal/
  VELVET-CIRCLE-COMMERCE-STATUS.md` — this is the current source of truth for everything
  money-related on the site. **Update it, don't just this file, whenever you change a price,
  a Payment Link, or the site's commerce config** — the Cowork/Make session reads that file too.
- **Legal pages content (Privacy/Terms/Shipping & Returns full text, what an attorney needs to
  know):** `~/Documents/Jennifer/07_Legal/Legal-Pages-Handoff-2026-07-23.md`.

If you (Claude Code) change anything commerce-related — a price, a product, a Stripe link,
the shop page — **update `VELVET-CIRCLE-COMMERCE-STATUS.md` before finishing**, the same way
you'd update this file for a code change. That file is shared with a separate Cowork/Make.com
session that builds the Stripe→Kit→Google Sheets automation; if it goes stale, that session
will act on wrong prices/links.

## 1. What this is — current status: 🟢 LIVE

Jennifer (Walcott) Archuleta's author/speaker/podcast site — memoir *Beyond the
Velvet Ropes*. **Live in production at https://jenarchuleta.com** (replaced her
old Squarespace site).

It is a **Next.js 14 (App Router, plain JavaScript — no TypeScript)** app:
- Static editorial pages (home, book) reusing a hand-built design-token CSS system.
- A **Podcast** page (native Buzzsprout player).
- A **Journal** blog powered by **Sanity CMS** (Jen self-publishes at `/studio`, no code).
- Email capture via **Kit** (ConvertKit) inline form.
- A **Shop** page selling a signed book copy, a paid membership, and a
  keepsake bookmark — see §5a.
- **Legal pages**: Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Shipping & Returns — see §5b.

**Local project folder:** `~/Documents/Jennifer/Website` (moved here from
`~/Downloads/Jennifer/Website` on 2026-07-24 — update any old notes/scripts that
still reference the Downloads path).

## 2. URLs & accounts (all IDs you need)

| Thing | Value |
|---|---|
| Live site | https://jenarchuleta.com (apex 301→ `www.jenarchuleta.com`) |
| Vercel preview/prod URL | https://jenarchuleta-site.vercel.app |
| **GitHub repo** | https://github.com/SpartanArch31/jenarchuleta-site (branch `main` auto-deploys; owner GitHub acct `SpartanArch31`) |
| **Vercel** | project `jenarchuleta-site`, team "spartanarch31's projects" (Hobby). Git-integrated → push to `main` = production deploy. **Access (checked 2026-10-24):** Hobby can't add team members (Pro = $20/mo platform incl. 1 deploying seat, +$20/mo per extra Owner/Member seat, Viewer seats free). Because this repo is **public**, a GitHub collaborator's pushes deploy on Hobby without a Vercel seat ("collaboration is free for public repositories"). Hobby is also non-commercial-only per Vercel's terms, and this site sells things — Pro fixes that. |
| **Sanity (CMS)** | project ID **`ac1ruwaz`**, dataset **`production`** (PUBLIC). Studio embedded at `/studio`. Manage: sanity.io/manage/project/ac1ruwaz |
| **Buzzsprout (podcast)** | show id **`2467154`**, feed `unfilteredwithjenarchuleta.buzzsprout.com` |
| **Kit (email)** | inline form uid **`ab5cfa4752`** (form 9625768); free-chapter landing slug `ea44cdb33a`. Kit also holds Commerce *product records* (cover art, tags) for all 4 shop products, but **Kit's own checkout is NOT used for real purchases** — see §5a. |
| **Stripe** | processes all real commerce checkout (Payment Links) — see §5a for current links. Merchant-of-record display name: "Archuleta Entertainment." |
| **Domain registrar / DNS** | **Network Solutions** (nameservers `ns85/ns86.worldnic.com`) |

No secrets live in this repo. Sanity projectId, Buzzsprout id, and Kit uid are all
public by design (they ship in the client bundle). Stripe Payment Link URLs are also
public by design (that's what a Payment Link is) — never commit a Stripe *secret* or
*restricted API key* here.

## 4. Run / build / deploy

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Jennifer/Website
npm install          # first time
npm run dev          # local dev → http://localhost:3000 (or pass -- --port 3100)
npm run build        # production build (run this to catch errors before pushing)
```

**Deploy:** commit + push to `main`. Vercel auto-builds and deploys to production.
```bash
git add . && git commit -m "describe change" && git push
```
Every push to `main` → live in ~1–2 min. Pushes to other branches → private preview
deploys (behind Vercel login).

---

## 5. How to make common changes (the "where do I edit X" guide)

- **Add / edit a blog post** → no code. Go to **jenarchuleta.com/studio**, log in
  (GitHub), **Journal Post → Create**, Publish. Appears on `/journal` in ~60s (ISR).
- **Change a post's category** → in `/studio`, open the post → **Category** dropdown → Publish.
- **Add/rename/remove a category** → edit `CATEGORIES` in `sanity/schemaTypes/post.js`
  AND `CATEGORY_ORDER` in `app/journal/page.js` (the feed only shows categories that have posts).
- **Homepage / book copy** → `app/page.js` / `app/book/page.js` (plain JSX; use real
  Unicode punctuation — ’ “ ” — … → — not HTML entities).
- **The "Meet Jen" photo row** (currently hidden, needs hi-res photos) → in `app/page.js`
  search `TODO photo-row hidden`; drop `jen-glam.jpg` + `jen-fun.jpg` into
  `public/assets/`, uncomment the block.
- **Book retailer links** (Amazon/B&N/Audiobook are `#` placeholders) → `app/page.js`
  (BOOK section) and `app/book/page.js` (buy-row).
- **Podcast show id / subscribe links** → `app/components/site-data.js` (`PODCAST`).
- **Email form** → `app/components/site-data.js` (`KIT_FORM_UID`, `KIT_FREE_CHAPTER_URL`).
  To restyle the form (e.g. brand-gold button) do it inside Kit, not in code.
- **Nav / footer / social links** → `app/components/SiteNav.js`, `SiteFooter.js`, `site-data.js`.
- **Redirects** → `next.config.js` (per-post ones are in `blog-redirects.json`).
- **Design tokens (colors/fonts/spacing)** → `app/tokens/*.css`. Brand accent gold = `#BE9543`.
- **Shop products / prices / Payment Links** → `app/components/site-data.js` (`SHOP` object).
  **Always check `~/Documents/Jennifer/07_Legal/VELVET-CIRCLE-COMMERCE-STATUS.md` for the
  current correct prices and links before editing this** — don't hardcode a price you're not
  sure is current.

### 5a. Shop / commerce — architecture rule, read before touching anything here

**Kit Commerce's own checkout cannot collect a shipping address, a custom field (e.g. book
personalization), or give a subscriber a self-service cancel option — for ANY product.** So
the live "Buy"/"Join" button on the site must always point to a **Stripe Payment Link**,
never to a Kit product's own checkout URL. This has been broken once already (a site update
accidentally pointed a Buy button at Kit's checkout, which silently had no shipping/
personalization fields) — don't repeat it. Kit product records may still exist off the site
(cover art, price, tags) and are used by the Make.com automation, but a real customer should
never land on Kit's own checkout page.

Current products (verify against `VELVET-CIRCLE-COMMERCE-STATUS.md` before trusting these —
that file is updated more frequently than this one):
- **Signed Copy** — $41.99 total ($35 + $6.99 shipping) — Stripe Payment Link, live.
- **Velvet Circle Membership** — $9.99/month — Stripe Payment Link. Cancel link is
  `STRIPE_CUSTOMER_PORTAL_URL` (capital I in the Stripe login id). It is on the shop
  membership card, the Velvet gate, and Shipping & Returns.
- **The Backstage Box** is not sold. It is not on the shop, the gate, or the legal pages.
- **Signature Velvet Bookmark** — $24.99, Stripe Payment Link.

The Stripe→Kit→Google Sheets automation (tagging buyers in Kit, logging orders to a Google
Sheet fulfillment tracker) is built and maintained in a separate Make.com scenario, not in
this repo — full detail in `VELVET-CIRCLE-COMMERCE-STATUS.md`.

### 5b. Legal pages

`/privacy`, `/terms`, `/shipping-returns` were added 2026-07-23, drafted by an AI assistant
(not a licensed attorney) using "Archuleta Entertainment" as the business name and Arizona as
governing law — both inferred from the Stripe checkout display name and existing marketing
copy, **not verified against an actual business registration.** Full original text and the
attorney-review checklist: `~/Documents/Jennifer/07_Legal/Legal-Pages-Handoff-2026-07-23.md`.
These pages have NOT been reviewed by counsel yet — don't represent them as final/binding.

---

## 6. Sanity CMS (the blog)

- **Schema:** `sanity/schemaTypes/post.js` — fields: title, slug, publishedAt, category,
  heroImage, excerpt, body (Portable Text), affiliateLinks[], sponsor{name,url,disclosure},
  seoTitle, seoDescription. Affiliate links auto-render an FTC disclosure; sponsor block
  renders only when set.
- **Studio:** embedded at `/studio`. Owner logs in with GitHub.
- **Let Jen publish herself:** sanity.io/manage/project/ac1ruwaz → **Members** → invite her email.
- **CORS** (already configured): jenarchuleta.com, www, localhost:3100, the .vercel.app domain.
  Add new origins with: `npx sanity cors add <url> --credentials`.
- **Data flow:** site reads PUBLISHED posts via the public dataset (no token). Journal
  post pages and the feed fetch with `cache: 'no-store'` (`app/journal/[slug]/page.js`
  is `force-dynamic`) so a publish shows on the next view. A 60s ISR window was
  serving the previous HTML after publish.
- **Bare URLs auto-link (2026-10-24):** `linkifyBody()` in `app/journal/[slug]/page.js` turns
  plain-text http(s) URLs in a post into real links at render time (the Squarespace migration
  left ~90 links as plain text, and URLs pasted in /studio arrive as plain text). External
  links open in a new tab. Nothing in Sanity is changed by this. Still prefer real links
  (select text → link icon in /studio) for nice link text.
- **CLI:** the Sanity CLI is logged in on this Mac. `npx sanity ...` works. If not:
  `npx sanity login` (pick GitHub).

---

## 7. Content migration (already done — 149 posts)

Jen's old Squarespace "blog" was actually a **765-post Instagram-style feed**. We migrated
the **149 substantive posts** (600+ chars of real writing) and skipped the hashtag/caption
noise. All 149 have images, real slugs, and auto-assigned categories. Old `/blog/...` URLs
redirect (see `blog-redirects.json` + catch-all in `next.config.js`).

Scripts live in `scripts/` (`migrate.py`, `classify.py`, `patch-categories.cjs`) — see
`scripts/README.md` to migrate more posts or re-categorize. The source export was the
Squarespace **WordPress XML** (Settings → Import & Export → Export → WordPress).

---

## 8. Domain & DNS (Network Solutions)

Website records (point to Vercel):
- `A  @  76.76.21.21`
- `CNAME  www  cname.vercel-dns.com`

**⚠️ DO NOT DELETE these — they keep Jen's newsletter email authenticated (Kit/ConvertKit):**
- `CNAME cka._domainkey`, `cka2._domainkey`, `ckespa` (DKIM/SPF)
- `TXT _dmarc`

`jen@jenarchuleta.com` **is live and receives mail** (confirmed 2026-07-24) — it's used as
the contact address on the site's legal pages (`/privacy`, `/terms`, `/shipping-returns`).

---

## 9. Open post-launch TODOs

1. **Photos** — add real hi-res `jen-glam.jpg` + `jen-fun.jpg` to `public/assets/`, un-hide
   the homepage photo row (§5). (Pasted/chat images are too low-res — need original files.)
2. **Book retailer links** — replace the `#` placeholders with real Amazon/B&N/Audiobook URLs.
3. **Kit form button color** — optional: set it to brand gold `#BE9543` inside Kit.
4. **Invite Jen** as a Sanity member so she can publish herself.
5. **Spot-check categories** — auto-classification is keyword-based; a few posts may want a
   manual category tweak in `/studio`.
6. **Commerce (check `VELVET-CIRCLE-COMMERCE-STATUS.md` for current detail):** confirm the
   Membership Payment Link and price are actually live in `site-data.js`; confirm the
   Shipping & Returns cancellation copy has been updated with the real Stripe portal link
   (both were instructed 2026-07-24, not yet confirmed shipped as of this writing).
7. **Legal pages** need a licensed attorney's review before being treated as final.

---

## 10. Gotchas / lessons learned (don't re-discover these)

- **Vercel must be framework=nextjs.** The project was first imported as a *static* "Other"
  preset, so builds failed with `No Output Directory named "dist"`. Fixed by `vercel.json`
  `{ "framework": "nextjs" }`. Keep that file.
- **Embedded Studio needs a client boundary.** `app/studio/.../page.jsx` must render the
  Studio from a `'use client'` component (`Studio.jsx`); importing `sanity.config` directly
  into the server page breaks the build (`createContext is not a function`).
- **Two pages, one .hero class** — the home and book heroes have different layouts; book's
  styles are scoped under `.book-page` (in `app/book/book.css`) so they don't collide.
- **CSS is ported verbatim** from the original static site to stay pixel-identical — when
  editing layout, change the tokens or the relevant page CSS, don't re-architect.
- **Don't put the inline Kit form on the dark book page** — it's a light form; the book page
  keeps the landing-page button instead.
- **Never point a physical-goods "Buy" button at a Kit checkout URL** — Kit Commerce can't
  collect shipping addresses or custom fields for any product. Stripe Payment Links only for
  the signed copy and the bookmark. See §5a.
- **A Make.com scenario "looking done" isn't the same as it being saved/active.** The
  Stripe→Kit→Sheets automation ran for over a day with an empty, deactivated scenario before
  anyone caught it (fixed 2026-07-24) — if you're ever asked to verify that automation is
  working, don't trust a screenshot of the visual builder; check the scenario's actual saved
  state and active/inactive flag.

- **No kids' faces anywhere on the site** (Jen's hard rule). `kids.jpg` on /about showed all
  three kids' faces — swapped 2026-10-24 for `dogs-on-the-bed.jpg` (a dogs-only crop of the
  same photo); the original is in `../_ARCHIVE/site-media-originals-2026-10-24/`.
- **Compress media before adding it.** Phones were slow because of a 21.9 MB trailer and
  700 KB+ photos. Now: `trailer.mp4` = 720×1280 H.264 CRF 28 (~7 MB; the 196 MB master is
  `../03_Trailer_Reel/BTVR_Reel_FINAL_VO.mp4`), photos ≤1000–1400 px wide at JPEG q80.
  Originals of everything recompressed are in `../_ARCHIVE/site-media-originals-2026-10-24/`.
- **The buy-row "Audiobook (Spotify)" link is the AUDIOBOOK, not the podcast.** Podcast
  subscribe buttons live in the homepage `#podcast` section and read from `PODCAST` in
  `site-data.js` (same as /podcast).
- **Name:** visible brand stays "Jen Archuleta"; book listings say "Jennifer Walcott
  Archuleta." JSON-LD in `app/layout.js` (Person, with alternateName) and `app/book/page.js`
  (Book) tells search engines they're the same person. /book's title matches the listings.

---

## 11. Safety

- **Never commit or paste passwords/API tokens.** This repo is public on GitHub.
- The site owner manages GitHub, Vercel, Sanity, Kit, Buzzsprout, Stripe, and Network
  Solutions accounts — automated sign-ins on their behalf are off-limits; hand account-level
  login steps back to them.

---

## 12. Automated safety net — commerce "Stop" hook (added 2026-07-24)

To stop the exact failure mode that happened today (a site-code instruction for the Membership
Payment Link + Shipping & Returns copy sat un-confirmed for hours, and separately a Make.com
automation ran broken for over a day, both only caught because a human happened to double-check),
this repo has a Claude Code **Stop hook**: `.claude/settings.local.json` registers
`.claude/hooks/check-commerce-log.sh` to run every time a session is about to finish.

**What it does:** if the session touched a commerce/legal-relevant path (`app/shop`,
`app/privacy`, `app/terms`, `app/shipping-returns`, `app/velvet`, or
`app/components/site-data.js`) and `../07_Legal/VELVET-CIRCLE-COMMERCE-STATUS.md` hasn't been
modified in the last 2 hours, the hook **blocks the session from stopping** and prints a message
telling Claude to go update that status file first. Exit code 2 = blocked; the session must act
before it's allowed to finish.

**What it does NOT cover:** anything outside this repo (Kit, Stripe, Make.com config changes made
directly in those dashboards, or Cowork-side brand/book/content work) — those rely on the Drive
BRAND HQ `STUDIO_LOG.md` + the standing "update before you finish" convention, not a hard gate.
This hook only closes the gap for site-code changes made through Claude Code in this repo.

**If you're troubleshooting it:** the hook script lives at `.claude/hooks/check-commerce-log.sh`
(bash, not tracked in git — local-only, see `.gitignore`). It checks `git status --porcelain` and
the last commit for relevant paths, then compares against the status file's mtime. If it's
misfiring (blocking when it shouldn't, or not blocking when it should), read the script — it's
short and heavily commented — before assuming something's broken elsewhere.
